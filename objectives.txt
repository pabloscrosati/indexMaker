1. Create list of all side chain heavy atoms, referenced from dictionary
    a. If list exists as file, import file, do not create
2. Create initial exclusion zone
3. Distance calculation between each side chain heavy atom and each Gdm center atom
    a. Parallelize this calculation, divided by equally by threads
    b. Multiple residue
4. Generate pair list for residue - Gdm pairs
5. Generate GROMACS-compatible index file
6. Extract time series data
7. Generate summary frequency distribution plot
