=== BASIC FUNCTIONALITY ===
[X] Read a series of GRO files                              PS
[X] Dictionary of side chain heavy atoms                    PS
[X] Gdm center atom                                         PS
[X] Adjustable cutoff distance                              PS
[X] Parallel program execution                              PS
[X] Exclusion criteria with COM                             KN, PS
[X] Generate pair list of residue - Gdm contacts            PS
[X] Create index file for each configuration                PS
[X] Multiple protein handler                                PS
[X] Time series extraction of Gdm contacts                  PS
[*] Frequency distribution                                  PS
    --> This feature was added in separate Excel worksheet  PS

1. Create list of all side chain heavy atoms, referenced from dictionary
    a. If list exists as file, import file, do not create
2. Create initial exclusion zone
3. Distance calculation between each side chain heavy atom and each Gdm center atom
    a. Parallelize this calculation, divided by equally by threads
    b. Multiple residue
4. Generate pair list for residue - Gdm pairs
5. Generate GROMACS-compatible index file
6. Extract time series data
7. Generate summary frequency distribution plot

=== TO BE DONE ===
[X] Properly implement GROMACS-compatible index file generation and bug fix
[X] Check whether functionality works with single GRO files and single-protein GRO files
[X] Implement single-threaded option
[X] Add all command-line functions and defaults
[X] Add CSV formatter
[X] Add protein indices to GROMACS-compatible index file

=== TESTING CHECKLIST ===
[X] Single protein chain, single-threaded
[X] Single protein chain, multi-threaded
[X] Multiple protein chains, single-threaded
[X] Multiple protein chains, multi-threaded
